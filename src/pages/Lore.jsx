        This section tries to explain the hidden secrets to a meaningful life.
        Let's start by defining a meaningful life.
      </p>
      <h5 className="text-center">What is a meaningful life?</h5>
      <p>
        A meaningful life is the day to day experience of a guiltless,
        regretless and painless life.
      </p>
      <h6 className="text-center">
        Why guilt? <br /> What do you mean by painless?
      </h6>
      <p>
        Feelings like worry, regret, pain, fear, resentment freeze us. They are
        the manifestation, the evidence of chaos. The kind of chaos that we dont
        want to face, the one that looks like a dragon. Scales, wings, feet,
        sharp claws and teeth... It is a scary monster.
      </p>
      <h6 className="text-center">How do I defeat the dragon?</h6>
      <p>
        First of all, you identify it and then you face it voluntarily. The
        earlier you face it the better, otherwise it starts to grow and evolve
        into a stronger dragon or maybe it starts to breed other mini version of
        itself. Think of this as a bill that you are procastinating to pay or
        that thesis that you are supposed to deliver in two weeks from now. The
        more you avoid them, the more expensive the bill becomes or the more
        stress we get from the thesis. Sharpen your sword and get your shield,
        they will be useful.
      </p>
      <h6 className="text-center">Sword and Shield?</h6>
      <p>
        Use the tools available to you. Start by negotiating with yourself...
        Ask yourself the following question:
      </p>
      <strong>
        What do I have to do in order for tomorrow to be a meaningful day?
